# Neovim Configuration

**This directory contains a personal Neovim configuration written in Lua.**

## About
This is a complete Neovim configuration located at `~/.config/nvim/`. It uses Lua-based configuration for modern Neovim features and plugin management.

## Aim
To have a lua based neovim config that I somewhat understand

## How to use
Clone the repo and rin the installer to install non-nvim stuff:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:TomGreenwood10/neovim_conf.git
chmod +x installer.sh 
./installer.sh
```
